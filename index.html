    <p class="index-text">Hi! <br><br>My name's Nami and I'm an intuitive tarot reader based in Northeast Florida. I've been reading tarot since Summer 2019 and don't plan on stopping. 
        <br>I'm dedicated to giving my clients clairty and guidance on whatever situation they inquire about, and it's brought me joy to see them moving forward in leaving their issues behind, and <br>going toward
        what will bring them happiness. I do readings on almost anything: Spirituality, Love, Career & Finances, and Life. <br><br>

        I've also helped out clients who are victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and other unfortunate circumstances. <br>And I am no stranger to helping clients figure out and clear issues dealing with the supernatural. <br><br>

        Because of that want to extend my services and bring justice to those who deserve it as well as closure. <br>Therefore, I'm lending a helping hand to law enforcement. 
        <br><br>Any law enforcement agencies wanting me to help out in person (only at the department, not on the scene) <b>MUST</b> be in these cities: <br><br>

        Jacksonville <br>Jacksonville Beach<br>Atlantic Beach<br>Orange Park<br> Middleburg<br><br> 

       I'm offering tarot readings on Missing Persons cases, Murder cases, Jane/John Doe cases, and other situations where police hit a wall.<br> 
        
       <br><b>Please note I will not take all cases offered to me. <br>Spiritual work can be very energetically taxing.
        <br>Another thing to note is since I could potentially be communicating with the deceased on these cases<br>
                there potentially will be some details that may not make sense or won't be communicated.<br>
           <br> I charge $60 an hour. 
       </b><br>

        <br>If you're interested on having me on a case, please don't hestitate to contact me:<br>
